You know that feeling when you finish an amazing book and all you want is another one just like it? Finding that next gem can be such a hassle.
That’s why I built Book Nook , a smart bookshelf management system that not only keeps track of your read/want-to-read books but also recommends new ones based on your bookshelf or custom requests.
With its cute, cozy UI featuring watercolor-inspired designs and playful animations, Book Nook makes exploring books a joyful, happy experience. 

Built with React, PostgreSQL, and Groq LPU API, it delivers personalized recommendations in real time.
